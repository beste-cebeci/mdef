Even though it was hard to merge our personal projects in some ways at the beginning, we all had the same vision of what we wanted this artifact to be. But I guess it was too broad or we couldn\u2019t word it well in the first presentation. I always find it hard to describe what I have in mind or what I develop during the process and explain it with words. I do believe that the outcome speaks for itself. I know for this class it was important to share our struggles and problem-solving for others and for ourselves, to help us in future projects. Echoes of Earth is an artifact that translates what is underneath the soil by reading soil moisture data and influencing a real-time root visual and sound. It also has LEDs to resemble fireflies, which ties the whole concept together by mimicking them in showcasing the health and condition of the soil. When we were ideating, one of the references resembled fireflies to me, and we all immediately started sharing our own stories of seeing them and how magical those moments felt. We didn\u2019t continue with it while developing the concept and the tech, but it somehow came back and completed the narrative of our project. This is definitely a work in progress. It has the potential to become more. Currently, it is a human-centric device that only reflects one single data. More sensors can be added, but also an action can be generated for it to expand the connection with earth that it creates. In my personal project, I will try to figure out ways to scan scars left on the environment . So learning about GPR and seeing what sensors we have felt like first steps toward that as well. Becoming aware of public datasets also gave me some ideas. I also really enjoyed working on this project because we were fewer people in the group and were able to divide the workload based on our interests and strengths. I worked on the digital visual output of the project in TouchDesigner. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s my strength because I haven\u2019t worked with it before, except for generating audio for another project. The visualization part and incorporating data were all new to me. So I followed lots of tutorials, mixed and matched their workflows, and Armin helped me a lot along the way. We ended up with a working skeleton, which didn\u2019t work properly during the presentation, so it wasn\u2019t as effective. When deciding what the visual should look like, I stuck with the idea that we wanted to show what we cannot see under the soil. I took reference from one of the root images in the datasets we found and tried to add movement and abstract it without losing too much detail. It still needs more tweaks and experimentation, but right now, as the sensor goes deeper into the soil, the particles come together from a scattered stage and form the root image. The data is also linked to base frequency levels, and the audio changes with different moisture levels, which supports the impact of the experience.

Knowing the conditions outside first thing in the morning to help define our mood felt like a positive addition to a daily routine. So, it was time to solidify the idea and figure out the steps to make it happen. From sunshine, we generalized the concept to weather, so it became like the weather itself was requesting a song, almost like a weather radio. The next question was what technology we had available and what data we wanted to use. We wanted to somehow incorporate both the local environmental status and the general city weather condition. We looked at different sensors at FabLab and decided to use a light sensor, since our initial idea was based on sunlight\u2019s effect on mood. To distribute the workload, we divided the group into pairs, and I was in the group handling the LDR sensor. The sensor gives analog light intensity values, where lower values indicate darkness and higher values indicate a brighter environment. From this point on, I\u2019m not completely sure I understand how the data transfer works from the Raspberry Pi to the AI agent through the network. However, it was very inspiring to become aware of the possibility of continuous data transfer through an input sensor for future projects. And we already used it on one. After connecting all the parts in the AI agent builder, we were able to get an output: the AI suggested a mood stabilizing song based on the sensor value and the online weather data it collected. The sensor value interpretation by the agent was questionable and needed more testing, because it still showed \u201cbright\u201d even after we blocked the light coming to the sensor. Still, we ended up with a working prototype that could be further developed. To develop the project further, we discussed doing deeper research on weather factors that affect our mood in order to better understand the topic and guide the agent more accurately. We also talked about improving the output by thinking about how and where the music recommendation could be played. A visual element, such as light, could be added, and the system could be integrated into smart homes or public transportation. Overall, my personal learning from this course was realizing how much I didn\u2019t know about using AI and its potential. I believe I would still prefer not to use it when it is not needed, but becoming aware of what can be done with it and how to use it properly was eye-opening. The importance of structure while prompting, shaping the text based on the desired outcome, showed me that it can also be a useful practice for communicating ideas more clearly.

Throughout the term, we worked with a wide range of tools and processes, including laser cutting, CNC milling, 3D printing, silicone molding, and bio-material casting. Rather than focusing only on outcomes, the course emphasized learning through experimentation, testing, and failure, which became one of the most valuable takeaways for me. Electronics and Barduino This was one of the most satisfying parts of the course for me. Learning how to identify and connect inputs and outputs, and understanding how they interact through code, was eye-opening. We experimented with components such as LEDs, buttons, touch sensors, and a micro servo motor. Figuring out how to control these elements through the board showed how digital logic can translate into physical movement, light, and interaction. Laser Cutting and Design for Fabrication As a group project, we laser cut an MDF box that later served as the container for a mold. One key lesson during laser cutting was the importance of accurate material measurement before fabrication. We initially assumed the MDF was sufficient, but it turned out to be approximately half a centimeter shorter than expected. If our instructor had not measured the material beforehand, the cut would have failed. This experience reinforced a fundamental rule of digital fabrication: never assume, always measure! Additionally, during the design phase, we learned about the importance of line spacing and kerf considerations. Our initial design had lines placed too close together, which caused cutting issues. We had to revise the design by increasing the distance between paths to ensure clean cuts. 3D Printing and Mold Making For the mold-making process, we designed and 3D printed a positive model that fit inside the laser-cut box. The printed form was a maze-like structure, and an important design consideration was ensuring that all shapes were properly merged into a single manifold object to avoid printing errors. Compared to other processes, 3D printing was relatively smooth. Silicone Molding and CNC Milling Silicone molding was one of my favorite parts of the course, as it clearly demonstrated how digital fabrication can interface with soft materials and casting processes. Creating the silicone mold from our 3D-printed positive allowed us to translate rigid digital geometry into a flexible, reusable mold. CNC milling, on the other hand, was more challenging. The combination of material choice, design geometry, and tool diameter led to some cracking, particularly around rounded corners. Maybe changing into a smaller milling bit could have produced better results. Bio-material Casting and Material Experimentation For the final casting step, we experimented with bio-material recipes, mixing two different formulations to observe how their properties interacted. The results were interesting, reinforcing the experimental nature of working with organic materials. One issue we encountered was with pigmentation: both indigo and food colorings failed to dry properly within the bio-material. Key Takeaways Overall, the course helped me understand making as a process of design, testing, failure, and refinement. Rather than seeing mistakes as setbacks, I learned to treat them as critical sources of information. The hands-on exposure to multiple fabrication techniques, combined with material experimentation, has given me a stronger foundation for future projects and appreciate process-driven design.","title":"Future Makers"},{"location":"mdef/futuremakers/fm/#fundamentals-for-future-makers-course-reflection","text":"The Fundamentals for Future Makers course was a highly engaging introduction to digital fabrication, material experimentation, and hands-on making.

From the outside, the MacBook presents itself as a clean, minimal, almost effortless machine. But the moment we removed the case, we were met with an entirely different reality; countless screws, layers of dust, and a maze of unidentified cables. Documenting each step and component turned out to be far more time consuming than I expected. Many of the internal parts were difficult to identify, especially elements on the motherboard that lacked labels or specifications. Still, it was fascinating to recognize components from brands like Intel and Samsung inside what is marketed as a purely \u201cApple\u201d product. Unraveling this previously sealed-off object was genuinely exciting. Seeing the sheer number of components required for the machine to function and imagining what each part might become in a new context was inspiring, even though very few of the parts still worked. My main focus ended up being documentation: photographing pieces, organizing them, and writing the inventory. I also attempted to get the screen\u2019s backlight working with Mikel\u2019s help, but I gave up rather quickly. It wasn\u2019t an LED screen, and the cables in it\u2019s inverter board were not specified, so it needed more trial and error. To be honest, forming the groups was my least favorite part of the class. I understand the logic of dividing by strengths and redistributing people, but the groups weren\u2019t balanced. We ended up in a large team, which made collaboration more challenging. Even so, the project sparked a lot of curiosity in me. I\u2019m already thinking about finding more broken devices to unpack, my next target is a camcorder. One major takeaway from this experience is something I\u2019ll never forget: never throw away a broken computer without dealing with the hard drive. By accessing the hard drive of the MacBook, we were able to find out who the laptop belonged to and even browse some of their personal files. It was a huge reminder of how easily someone\u2019s data can be exposed. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want that to happen to me, and I\u2019ll keep this lesson in mind moving forward.
